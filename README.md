- 👋 Hi, I’m @JMH5768
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and data analytics. Particularly the science of image processing for early diagnosis of medical conditions and natural language 
processing to reveal trends and attitudes across various social media platforms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how word embedding is used to identify, extract, quantify, and study subjective information.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving social and/or medical influence.
